    st.write("""
    The social life of everyone has become associated with the online social networks. These sites have made a drastic change in the way we pursue our social life. Making friends and keeping in contact with them and their updates has become easier. But with their rapid growth, many problems like fake profiles, online impersonation have also grown. Fake profiles often spam legitimate users, posting inappropriate or illegal content. Several signs can help you spot a social media fake who might be trying to scam your business.

    st.subheader("Data Analysis:")
    st.write("""
    The project begins with a comprehensive analysis of various features extracted from social media profiles. These features include the presence of a profile picture, the ratio of numbers to the length of the username, the number of words in the full name, and more.

    st.subheader("Machine Learning Model:")
    st.write("""
    A robust machine learning model is employed for training and evaluation. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled instances of real and fake profiles. This enables the system to learn patterns and characteristics associated with genuine and deceptive profiles.

    st.write("""
    Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a class of machine learning models inspired by the biological neural networks of the human brain. In our project, ANN plays a crucial role in analyzing social media profiles to distinguish between real and fake accounts. ANN consists of interconnected nodes arranged in layers, where each node processes information received from the previous layer through non-linear transformations. By training on a dataset containing labeled instances of real and fake profiles, the ANN learns to recognize intricate patterns and relationships within the data. Through this process, ANN effectively captures the underlying characteristics that differentiate genuine profiles from deceptive ones, enabling accurate predictions of profile authenticity.

    st.subheader("Decision Trees:")
    st.write("""
    Decision Trees are hierarchical structures used for classification and regression tasks in machine learning. In our project, Decision Trees are employed as part of the machine learning model to assess the authenticity of social media profiles. Decision Trees recursively split the dataset based on the features extracted from the profiles, aiming to maximize the homogeneity of the resulting subsets. Each split represents a decision based on a specific feature, allowing the model to capture complex relationships between profile attributes and authenticity. Decision Trees are particularly interpretable, providing insights into the criteria used for classification. By utilizing Decision Trees in our project, we can effectively analyze profile data and make accurate predictions regarding profile authenticity.
